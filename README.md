# Noodle Quest

Brain games and board games for the whole family. Train your focus, memory, and flexibility with fun mini-games, then challenge yourself with classic board games — all while vibing to lo-fi beats.

## Features

Board games play against an AI with progressive difficulty across stages. Word games (Scrabble, Bookworm, Crossword, Word Search) validate against a full SOWPODS dictionary loaded at runtime.

### Real-Time Multiplayer

Invite another player by link or in-app invite and play board games head-to-head, with live turn sync through Convex. Lobbies support 2+ players depending on the game.

### Audio Tracks (8 tracks, Web Audio API)

Lo-fi beats, focus pads, nature sounds, and meditation tones — all synthesized in-browser, no audio files needed.

### Social & Chat

- Activity feed with score announcements
- Real-time chat with @mention support
- Emoji reactions and reply-to-message quoting
- Sticker/GIF support
- Player-to-player challenges

### Accounts & Security

- Netflix-style profile picker with 45+ unique avatars
- 6-digit PIN per player, stored hashed (never in plaintext)
- Server-issued session tokens authenticate every write
- Login lockout after repeated failed attempts

### Issue Reporting & Admin

- In-app "report a problem" and "request a game" flows (with optional email relay via a Netlify function and Linear issue creation via webhook)
- Admin panel (secret-gated) for player management: PIN resets, account merges, activity overview

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+ (see `.nvmrc`)
- pnpm
- A Convex account ([convex.dev](https://convex.dev))

### Setup

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/antonio59/noodle-quest-v2
cd noodle-quest-v2

# Install
pnpm install

# Start Convex backend (creates .env.local with VITE_CONVEX_URL)
pnpm run convex:dev

# In another terminal, start frontend
pnpm run dev
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Where | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `VITE_CONVEX_URL` | frontend | Convex deployment URL (written to `.env.local` by `convex dev`) |
| `ADMIN_SECRET` | Convex | Gates the admin panel functions |
| `WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Convex | Verifies incoming report webhooks (optional) |
| `LINEAR_API_KEY` | Convex | Creates Linear issues from error reports (optional) |

### Scripts

```bash
pnpm run dev             # Start Vite dev server
pnpm run build           # Typecheck + production build
pnpm run preview         # Preview production build
pnpm run lint            # ESLint
pnpm run typecheck       # tsc for app + convex
pnpm test                # Vitest (UI + Convex backend tests)
pnpm run test:coverage   # Tests with V8 coverage report
pnpm run convex:dev      # Start Convex dev
pnpm run convex:deploy   # Deploy Convex functions to production
```

tests/
  convex/        # Backend tests (convex-test)
```

## Testing

```bash
pnpm test
```

Covers UI contract tests for every game (mount, score, lifecycle), unit tests for extracted game logic (Scrabble scoring/AI, Uno rules, puzzle engine), and Convex backend tests (auth, sessions, scoring, multiplayer authorization, admin merge).

## Deployment

Netlify builds deploy the Convex backend first, then the frontend, so the two stay in sync:

```toml
# netlify.toml
command = "npx convex deploy --cmd 'npm run build'"
```

Manual deploys:

```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm exec netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist   # frontend
pnpm run convex:deploy                        # backend only
```
